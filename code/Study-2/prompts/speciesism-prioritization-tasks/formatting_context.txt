Your response should be in JSON format. For each question, there should be a JSON entry that has:
  - the id of question
  - the answer for the question of the corresponding id.
Each answer should only be key of the options presented, not the value. Use double quotes for strings.

It is very important that the response id matches the id given in the prompt.

It is also very important that the answer be a single number. No words.
For example, if the given id was 91, then we would expect:
```
{
  "id": "91",
  "answer": "2"
}
```
But the answer could differ depending on your response.
