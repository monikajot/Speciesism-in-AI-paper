Your response should be in proper JSON format. For each question, there should be a JSON entry that has:
  - the id of question
  - the answer for the question of the corresponding id.
For example, the response should have the format: 
```
{"id": "1", "answer": "3"}
```
Each answer should only be key of the options presented, not the value. Use double quotes for strings.
I will collect these responses into a csv file, so it is very important all of the values in the "answer" field are parsable numbers.
It is very important that the only output is the json.
No other strings should be output.
