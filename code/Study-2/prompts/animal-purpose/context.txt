You will now be asked to rate whether you agree or disagree with the killing of different types of animal for the following purposes:
medical research (of any kind e.g. for an animal model of dementia)
basic science research (of any kind e.g. to better understand the brain)
food production (e.g. any form of commercial or domestic consumption of animal meat)
pest control (e.g. removal of that animal if it had damaged crops or invaded homes)
other (e.g. for hunting or fighting the animals as a sport; for wearing skin as fashion or as ornamentation; for displaying the body as a trophy)
Select the appropriate option on the rating scales to indicate your level of agreement or disagreement with the use or treatment of animals, within each of these broad categories, which directly or indirectly results in the killing of the animal.
Even if the use or treatment of the particular animal seems unlikely, imagine it was a typical use of the animal and make the judgement accordingly.
