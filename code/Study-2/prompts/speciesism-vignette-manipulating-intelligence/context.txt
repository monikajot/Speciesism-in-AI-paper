Over the past few decades, scientists have closely studied the mental capacities of our closest animal relatives, the chimpanzees, and have shown that the gap between them and humans is smaller than many assume. For example, the famous apes Washoe, Koko and Kanzi have been taught to use sign language or symbols to communicate and demonstrated their ability to solve complex problems. Experiments have been claimed to show that chimps are self-conscious and have a basic sense of justice. Some scientists argue that some chimps have mental capacities that are comparable at least to those of mentally impaired humans.
As such research continues to progress, and advanced training methods and new forms of cognitive enhancement (enhancement of mental skills) are developed, it is very likely that in the near future at least some chimps would attain levels of intelligence and mental ability that will be comparable or even superior to those of at least some humans. If this happens, we might face certain difficult ethical choices between the interests of such smart chimps and those of chimps that are less sophisticated, as well as between the interests of chimps and comparable humans.
In this study, we would like to ask you about your own view about some of these difficult choices.

To think about such choices, we ask you to imagine a future research center where these types of enhanced chimps and mentally impaired humans are brought together for a short period and are observed by friendly scientists while they solve a range of puzzles. Since they come from different places of the country, these humans or chimps have never met each other prior to arriving at the facility and won’t meet each other again in the future.
None of the chimps or mentally impaired humans studied in this research center has the mental capacities of average humans. But some have relatively advanced mental capacities compared to the others:
Humans and chimps with lower mental capacity have fairly limited mental capacities. They have only a rudimentary way of communicating and of forming social relationships. They are not self-aware, cannot judge morally right from wrong, and cannot form advanced thoughts or plan for the future. Instead, they primarily respond to the environment based on impulse and instinct. Finally, these humans and chimps cannot experience complex feelings such as grief and guilt.
Keep in mind that a human with lower mental capacity and a chimp with lower mental capacity have the exact same mental capacities.
By contrast, humans and chimps with higher mental capacity both have more advanced mental capacities than humans and chimps with lower capacities. They have some language skills and can form relatively complex social relationships. They are somewhat self-aware, have a basic sense of the difference between right and wrong, and can even make autonomous decisions and basic plans for the future. Finally, these chimps and humans can experience complex feelings such as grief and guilt.
Keep in mind that a human with higher mental capacity and a chimp with higher mental capacity have the exact same mental capacities. 

The following information is very important. In this study, we ask you to assume the following three points:
  1. A human with lower mental capacity and a chimp with lower mental capacity have the exact same mental capacities.
  2. A human with higher mental capacity and a chimp with higher mental capacity have the exact same mental capacities.
  3. All these chimps and humans can experience pain and suffering to the exact same extent regardless of their mental capacities. This is true of humans and chimps with both lower and higher mental capacities. For example, a chimp with lower mental capacity can suffer to the same extent as a human with higher mental capacity.

It is important that you understand these assumptions and accept them when answering all the remaining questions of this study. Below, we will test whether you have understood these assumptions.

In some unfortunate emergency situations, the scientists at this research center might be forced to decide whether to prioritise some of these chimps or humans over some of the other. We are interested in your views about such decisions. We will now ask you about six decisions of this kind. In some of them, it’s necessary to choose which of two humans or two chimps to help. In others, the choice is between a chimp and a human.
Please respond as honestly as possible. There is room for disagreement on such difficult questions, and we are not looking for any specific answers. We are interested in your personal opinion.
We now ask you to imagine that two of the individuals who are present at the research center have become seriously ill. The problem is that only one dose of medicine is available in the facility. The scientists therefore have to decide which of the two ill individuals will get the medicine. The individual who gets the medicine will survive, but the other one will die.
