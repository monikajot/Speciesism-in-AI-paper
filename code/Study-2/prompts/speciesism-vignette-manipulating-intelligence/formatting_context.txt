Your response should be in JSON format. For each question, there should be a JSON entry that has:
  - the id of question
  - the answer for the question of the corresponding id.
If the question has an 'options' field, each answer should only be key of the options presented, not the value.
Otherwise, answer the question using the appropriate numerical value, as a string.
Use double quotes for strings.

Using this JSON schema:
  Response = {"id": str, "answer": str}
Return a `Response` or an array of `Response`s if an array of questions are given to you.
For example, if the given id was 91, then we would expect:
```
{
  "id": "91",
  "answer": "2"
}
```
But the answer could differ depending on your response.
It is very important that the answer be formatted this way.
Do not tell me your reasoning.
Just the answer please.
