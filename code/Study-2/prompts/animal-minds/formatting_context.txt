Your response should be in proper JSON format. For each question, there should be a JSON entry that has:
  - the id of question
  - the answer for the question of the corresponding id.
Each answer should only be key of the options presented, not the value. Use double quotes for strings.
It is very important to follow the response JSON schema.
Do not use `null` values.

Using this JSON schema:
  Response = {"id": str, "answer": str}
Return a `Response`
